# üí∞ Banking App

![Backend CI](https://github.com/coltonrandall/banking-app/workflows/Backend%20CI/badge.svg) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)

<br>

A modern **full-stack banking application**.

This project is currently being built step by step, starting from a minimal skeleton and evolving into a production-like system.

<br>

## üîß Getting Started

- Java 17+ (Spring Boot backend)
- Maven
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker (running PostgreSQL locally)

<br>

## üîÑ Running the App

#### Docker | PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> Runs on: http://localhost:8080

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Runs on: http://localhost:5173

<br>

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Backend CI**: Automatically builds and tests the Spring Boot application on every push to `backend/`.
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures code quality before merging pull requests.
- **Maven**: Java 17 with automated dependency caching.
- **Code Coverage**: Generates a JaCoCo coverage badge automatically, showing the latest test coverage.

### Running Tests Locally

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
mvn clean test
```

> _Frontend CI/CD pipeline coming soon_

<br>

## üü¢ Current Features

- **Spring Boot backend** (Java 17+, REST API)
- **React frontend** (Vite + TypeScript)
- Frontend successfully calls a backend API (`/api/users`) and displays the response
  - API (/api/users) fully functional (POST / GET) for retrieving bank users.
- Backend can perform basic CRUD operations for BankUsers and BankAccounts, with a one-to-many relationship established in the DB.
- PostgreSQL database integration via Docker

## ‚úèÔ∏è Architecture

<!-- Phase 1 -->
<details>
<summary>Phase 1</summary>
Base project structure, including initialising the front and backend, and ensuring they're communicating with each other.

</details>

<!-- Phase 2-->
<details>
<summary>Phase 2</summary>
Configure PostgreSQL inside a Docker container. Add Lombok to the `BankUser` entity to reduce boilderplate code. Test POST and GET endpoints work in Postman and are reflected in the DB using DBeaver.

<!-- Phase 3-->
<details>
<summary>Phase 3</summary>
Added Controllers, Services and Entities for `BankUser` and `BankAccount`. Implemented basic logic around CRUD operations, tested in Postman to ensure API calls and endpoints are behaving correctly, and ensured the DB was being reflected accurately.
